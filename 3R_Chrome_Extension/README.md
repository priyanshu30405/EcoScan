# EcoScan Chrome Extension

EcoScan is a Chrome extension that helps users find eco-friendly products on e-commerce websites. It automatically modifies search queries to include eco-friendly terms and filters results to show only sustainable products.


## Product Filtering Process

2. **Content Analysis**:

   - Analyzes product attributes and specifications

3. **Filtering Logic**:
